The dataset used for training our model is:
# UCI Machine Learning Repository: Online News Popularity Data Set.
Abstract: This dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable in a period of two years. The goal is to predict the number of shares in social networks (popularity).
